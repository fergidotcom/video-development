# This report identifies video files with unusual formats that may need special handling
#================================================================================

## UNUSUAL FORMAT FILES (Possible 360°/3D Camera)

These 2 files have a 2880x2880 SQUARE format, suggesting they were shot with a
360-degree or 3D camera. They cannot be compressed with standard settings.

1. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/MyMovieWithVinny/170801VinnyBringsLunchForSoundCheck/FlyVinnySoundCheck.MP4
   - Resolution: 2880x2880 (square)
   - Duration: 31 minutes
   - Size: 11.0 GB
   - Project: MyMovieWithVinny
   - Action: Review if needed, may require special 360° viewer

2. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/PeirceGang/170804PeirceGangTheOrderOfNature/PeirceGangOrb.MP4
   - Resolution: 2880x2880 (square)
   - Duration: 82 minutes
   - Size: 29.0 GB
   - Project: PeirceGang
   - Action: Review if needed, may require special 360° viewer


## LARGE 4K FILES (Compression Timeout - NOT Unusable)

These files failed compression due to their extreme length (2.5-3 hours of 4K each),
NOT because of format issues. They are perfectly usable but need extended timeout.

1. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/190205JeffreyAndPop/Pop1.MP4
   - Resolution: 3840x2160 (4K)
   - Duration: 3 hours 3 minutes (11,013 sec)
   - Size: 68.0 GB
   - Status: Normal 4K video, compression needs longer timeout

2. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/201227JoeFergusonLifeStoryByJeff/Jeff.MP4
   - Resolution: 3840x2160 (4K)
   - Duration: 2 hours 47 minutes (10,005 sec)
   - Size: 62.8 GB
   - Status: Normal 4K video, compression needs longer timeout

3. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/MyMovieWithVinny/171018SantaBarbaraKjell/CounterCam.MP4
   - Resolution: 3840x2160 (4K)
   - Duration: 2 hours 53 minutes (10,395 sec)
   - Size: 66.9 GB
   - Status: Normal 4K video, compression needs longer timeout

4. /Volumes/Promise Pegasus/MyMovieWithVinny/180117LewWatts/Lew.MP4
   - Resolution: 3840x2160 (4K)
   - Duration: 2 hours 34 minutes (9,263 sec)
   - Size: 60.8 GB
   - Status: Normal 4K video, compression needs longer timeout


## RECOMMENDATION

For the 360°/3D files:
- Use a 360° video player (like GoPro VR Player or VLC with 360 plugin) to view
- Consider if these have narrative value - they may be interesting experiments
- Standard compression won't work - would need equirectangular → flat conversion first

For the long 4K files:
- These are important content (Jeffrey/Pop life story, Vinny project interviews)
- Can be compressed manually with Compressor using extended timeout
- Estimated compression time: 4-6 hours each due to length
